Some common approaches include removing outliers, transforming the data, using robust statistical methods, or treating the outliers as a separate group. It's important to carefully consider the reasons for the outliers and their potential impact on the analysis before deciding on an approach."

Answer: A scatter plot is a visual representation of bivariate relationships between two continuous variables, and it can help identify any potential patterns, trends, or relationships between the variables. Outliers can also be identified using a scatter plot if there are any data points that are far from the general pattern or trend of the data points."

Describe how cross-tabs can be used to figure out how two variables are related.Answer: Cross-tabulation, or contingency tables, is a technique used to examine the relationship between two categorical variables. It involves the creation of a table that displays the distribution of one variable relative to the other variable, allowing for the identification of any associations or patterns between the two. This method can be used to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between the two variables, as well as to identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies in the data."
