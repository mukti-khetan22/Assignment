    "1. Define the Bayesian interpretation of probability. Answer: The Bayesian interpretation of probability is that it represents a degree of belief or confidence in the occurrence of an event, based on prior knowledge and evidence. It is calculated using Bayes' theorem, which updates the prior probability with new information to obtain a posterior probability."

The formula for conditional probability is: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where P(A ∩ B) is the joint probability of A and B, and P(B) is the probability of B."

Answer: The Bernoulli distribution is a probability distribution representing the probability of a single binary event, such as success or failure. Its formula is: P(X=x) = p^x * (1-p)^(1-x), where p is the probability of success, x is the outcome (0 or 1), and (1-p) is the probability of failure."

Answer: The binomial distribution is a probability distribution representing the probability of a specific number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, with a constant probability of success. Its formula is: P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, p is the probability of success, k is the number of successful trials, and (n choose k) is the binomial coefficient."

Answer: The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution representing the probability of a certain number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence. Its formula is: P(X=k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!, where λ is the average rate of occurrence and k is the number of events."
