    "    i. Underfitting in machine learning models occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data. The most common reason for underfitting is using a model with insufficient complexity, such as a linear model for nonlinear data.\n",

    "iii. The bias-variance trade-off is a fundamental concept in model fitting that refers to the trade-off between model complexity and generalization performance. A model with high bias is too simple and underfits the data, while a model with high variance is too complex and overfits the data. The goal is to find the right balance between bias and variance to achieve good generalization performance on new, unseen data. Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, can help achieve this balance by penalizing complex models and preventing overfitting."
