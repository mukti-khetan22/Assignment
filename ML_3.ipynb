    "applications could raise? Answer: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. Two examples of machine learning applications in the business world are fraud detection in financial transactions and customer segmentation for targeted marketing. Ethical concerns that machine learning applications could raise include bias, privacy violations, and unintended consequences."

The data is collected and preprocessed, and the appropriate model is selected based on the problem. The model is trained using the prepared data, and its performance is evaluated using a validation dataset. The model is then adjusted or fine-tuned as necessary to improve its performance. Once the model has been successfully trained and validated, it can be deployed to make predictions on new data."
