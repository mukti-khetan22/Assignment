    "1. What is the concept of supervised learning? What is the significance of the name? Answer:Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from labeled data to predict outcomes for new, unseen data. In supervised learning, the training data set includes both the input and output data, and the goal of the model is to learn the mapping function from the input to the output. The name \"supervised\" learning comes from the fact that the training data set is labeled with the correct outputs, allowing the model to learn from the labeled examples and make predictions on new, unseen examples."

    "2. In the hospital sector, offer an example of supervised learning. Answer: An example of supervised learning in the hospital sector is predicting patient readmission. In this scenario, the model is trained on a dataset of patient records that includes features such as age, medical history, diagnosis, and treatment. The model learns to predict whether a patient is likely to be readmitted within a certain period based on these features, using a labeled dataset where each record indicates whether the patient was readmitted or not. The model can then be used to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from additional care or interventions to reduce the likelihood of readmission."

    "7. In SVM, what is the cost of misclassification? Answer: In SVM, the cost of misclassification refers to the penalty associated with misclassifying a data point. The cost of misclassification is determined by the regularization parameter, C, which controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high value of C will result in a smaller margin and a lower training error, but it may lead to overfitting and a higher testing error. On the other hand, a low value of C will result in a larger margin and a higher training error, but it may lead to underfitting and a higher testing error.\n",

    "The cost of misclassification also depends on the type of error made. In SVM, there are two types of errors: false positives and false negatives. A false positive occurs when a negative sample is classified as positive, while a false negative occurs when a positive sample is classified as negative. The cost of misclassification can be adjusted differently for false positives and false negatives based on the application requirements."

    "8. In the SVM model, define Support Vectors.

Support Vectors are critical to the SVM model because they define the location and orientation of the hyperplane and determine the margin.\n",
