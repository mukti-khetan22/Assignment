    "# The difference is that list comprehensions eagerly evaluate all the values and store them in memory, while generator expressions lazily evaluate the values and produce them on-the-fly, saving memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generators are a type of iterator. Iterators are objects that implement the iterator protocol, which includes the methods __iter__() and __next__(). Generators are created using generator functions or generator expressions, and they automatically implement the iterator protocol. They can be iterated over using a for loop or by calling the next() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A function is a generator function if it contains the keyword 'yield' at least once. When called, a generator function returns a generator object. The generator object can be iterated over, and each call to its next() method will execute the code in the generator function until a yield statement is encountered. The yield statement pauses the function and returns a value, and the function's state is saved so that it can be resumed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The yield statement is used in generator functions to define points at which the function should yield a value. When the function encounters a yield statement, it temporarily suspends its execution, returns the yielded value, and saves its internal state. The function can then be resumed from where it left off the next time its next() method is called. This allows generators to generate a sequence of values on-the-fly, without having to compute and store all the values at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Both map calls and list comprehensions are used to apply a function to a sequence of elements and generate a new sequence based on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# List comprehensions offer a concise and readable way to create new lists by transforming or filtering existing lists. They use a declarative syntax and are enclosed in square brackets. List comprehensions can incorporate conditional statements and nested loops, allowing for complex transformations in a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Map calls, on the other hand, are functional programming constructs that apply a function to each element of an iterable and return an iterator that yields the transformed values. Map calls use a functional syntax and are written as map(function, iterable). Unlike list comprehensions, map calls do not support conditional statements or multiple input iterables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In terms of performance, list comprehensions are generally faster than map calls for simple transformations, as they avoid the overhead of function calls. However, for more complex operations or when working with large data sets, map calls can be more memory-efficient, as they produce an iterator rather than creating a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overall, the choice between list comprehensions and map calls depends on the specific use case, readability requirements, and the need for additional features like conditional filtering or multiple input iterables.\n"
