Model based learning algorithm search for the optimal value of parameters in a model that will give the best results for the new instances. We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function."

Answer: Your model is overfitting your training data when you see that the model performs well on the training data but does not perform well on the evaluation data. This is because the model is memorizing the data it has seen and is unable to generalize to unseen examples. Such as, if it performs well with the training data, but does not perform well with the test dataset, then it is estimated that the model may be overfitted.\n",
