    "1. What is prior probability? Give an example. Answer: Prior probability is the probability of an event based on existing knowledge or information, before taking into account new data or evidence. An example of prior probability is the probability of a coin landing heads up, which is 0.5 assuming the coin is fair, before flipping the coin and observing the outcome."

    "4. What is Naïve Bayes classifier? Why is it named so? Answer: Naïve Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, based on Bayes' theorem and the assumption that the features are conditionally independent. It is named \"naïve\" because it assumes that the features are independent, which is often not the case in real-world problems, but still produces good results in practice."
