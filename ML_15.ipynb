Answer:Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. In contrast, unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, where the algorithm learns from a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data."

    "4. Go through the SVM model in depth using various scenarios. Answer:the SVM model involves selecting a decision boundary that maximizes the margin between the different classes of data points. This decision boundary is selected by solving a constrained optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the classification error subject to the margin constraint. The SVM model also uses kernel functions to transform the data into higher-dimensional feature spaces, where it becomes easier to find a linear decision boundary."

    "6. Go over the kNN model in depth. Answer: The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) model is a non-parametric and instance-based algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm is based on the idea of finding the k closest neighbors to a given data point and classifying the data point based on the majority class of those k neighbors. The value of k is chosen by the user and plays a crucial role in the model's performance. The kNN model is simple, easy to implement, and can handle multi-class problems, but it can be computationally expensive and sensitive to irrelevant features in the data."

Answer:The kNN algorithm's error rate and validation error can be reduced by adjusting the value of k, the number of nearest neighbors considered. A small k value leads to high variance, while a large k value leads to high bias. The optimal k value can be determined through cross-validation or other methods. The validation error can be calculated by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels in a validation dataset. The goal is to minimize the validation error while avoiding overfitting."

Answer:A decision tree is a graphical representation of a set of decisions and their possible outcomes. It consists of nodes that represent decision points and branches that represent the possible paths that can be taken. The various types of nodes in a decision tree include the root node, internal nodes, and leaf nodes. The root node is the starting point of the tree, while internal nodes represent decision points. The leaf nodes represent the possible outcomes or classifications of the problem being solved."

It involves recursively splitting the data into smaller subsets based on the most significant feature at each node. The algorithm works by calculating the information gain of each feature and choosing the one with the highest information gain as the splitting criterion. The process continues until all data is classified or the stopping criterion is met."

Answer:Inductive bias in decision trees is the underlying assumption that guides the learning algorithm to predict the target variable based on the input variables. Overfitting in decision trees can be prevented by pruning the tree, setting a minimum number of observations per leaf, or by using a random forest approach."

This helps to reduce overfitting and increase accuracy."

Answer:In a random forest model, OOB (out-of-bag) error is a metric used to estimate the performance of the model on new, unseen data. It is calculated using the data points that were not used during the training of a particular decision tree. Variable importance is another metric used in random forests to determine the significance of each input feature in predicting the target variable. It is calculated by measuring the amount of reduction in predictive accuracy when a particular input feature is removed from the model."
