    "# 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions?\n",
    "# Def statements are used to define named functions in Python. They allow you to create reusable blocks of code that can be called later.\n",
    "# Lambda expressions, on the other hand, are anonymous functions that can be defined in a single line. They are often used for small and simple operations.\n",
    "# Both def statements and lambda expressions are used to create functions, but lambda expressions are typically used for short and one-time operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "square_lambda = lambda x: x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "# The benefit of lambda expressions is that they allow you to create small, inline functions without the need for a def statement.\n",
    "# Lambda expressions are useful when you need a function for a short and specific operation, and you don't want to define a separate named function.\n",
    "# They are commonly used in combination with higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sort().\n",
    "\n",
    "pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]\n",

    "# 3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "# - map() applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator of the results.\n",
    "# - filter() applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator of the items for which the function returns True.\n",
    "# - reduce() applies a given function to the first two items in an iterable, then to the result and the next item, and so on, reducing the iterable to a single value.\n",

    "# 4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "# Function annotations are a way to add metadata to the parameters and return types of functions.\n",
    "# They provide additional information about the expected types of the arguments and the type of the return value, although they do not enforce the types.\n",
    "# Function annotations are defined using a colon after the parameter name, followed by the type hint.\n",

    "# 5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "# Recursive functions are functions that call themselves during their execution.\n",
    "# They are used to solve problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems that are similar to the original problem.\n",
    "# Recursive functions have a base case that defines the termination condition, and a recursive case that breaks the problem down into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "# The function keeps calling itself with smaller inputs until the base case is reached.\n",

    "# 6. What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n",
    "# - Use descriptive names for functions that indicate their purpose or operation.\n",
    "# - Keep functions modular and focused on a single task to promote code reuse and maintainability.\n",
    "# - Use appropriate parameters and return types that accurately describe the inputs and outputs of the function.\n",
    "# - Avoid using global variables within functions, as they can introduce unexpected side effects.\n",
    "# - Add comments and documentation to explain the purpose, usage, and assumptions of the function.\n",
